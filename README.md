# LogQL

A time-based categorical Logging Query Language.

## Abstract

When we are developing a large code application base, the logging stream
becomes a mess. There are lots of unnecessary log messages shown up. In that
log messages, there are common parts such as time, log severity, and the
message itself. From this point, we could find our needed log message by it's
occured time. Also, often, we categorize the log messages by something like
feature or component. Therefore, based on this problem, we are trying to
create a Logging Query Language that could retrieve a log message based on
date time, category, or even its log message. With sorting and data limitation
system, we could retrieve necessary log message.
